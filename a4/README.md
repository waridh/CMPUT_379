## Objectives
From my point of view, we learned how to use mutexes to protect critical
sections of the code (shared resources) and synchronize threads. We also needed
to prevent deadlocks using one of the methods we learnt in lecture. The method
for deadlock prevention that was used in this assignment was by preventing
circular wait.
