# CMPUT_379
My repository for CMPUT 379 Operating systems class. I recommend that when you take this class, to do all the assignments in C, and not C++ as I did. This would reinforce your understanding of the computer architecture more, especially when you are not given access to advanced data structures like maps and vectors. I received 100% on all of these solutions, so they should be good benchmarks if you want to practice implementing your own solution. I cannot remember if I had included the task for each of the assignment so feel free to create an issue for those.

## Recommended tools

Use CLANG instead of gcc or g++, it will be much more compatible all your operating systems, however this class specifically foocuses on UNIX programming, so I think that you would greatly benefit from using a UNIX like operating system that is POSIX compliant. LLVM is also better than whatever each operating systems have to offer.  
The textbook (Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment) is also a really good tool for this class, teaches you lots of things. Good luck, I suppose.
