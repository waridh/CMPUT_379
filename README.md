# CMPUT_379
My repository for CMPUT 379 Operating systems class. I recommend that when you take this class, to do all the assignments in C, and not C++ as I did. This would reinforce your understanding of the computer architecture more, especially when you are not given access to advanced data structures like maps and vectors.
