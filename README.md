# CMPUT_379
My repository for CMPUT 379 Operating systems class. I recommend that when you take this class, to do all the assignments in C, and not C++ as I did. This would reinforce your understanding of the computer architecture more, especially when you are not given access to advanced data structures like maps and vectors.

## Recommended tools

Use CLANG instead of gcc or g++, it will be much more compatible with your windows machine, and allows for race condition detections. LLVM is also better than whatever each operating systems have to offer.  
The textbook is also a really good tool for this class, teaches you lots of things. Good luck, I suppose.
