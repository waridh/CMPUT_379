// Assignment 1 Part 1 Question 3

/*
We are trying to split each input into a token. The tokens are delimited
by field separators. The field separators we are going to be using are
newline whitespace and tab. Assume that each token has at most 20 - 1
characters. We also need to store the  number of tokens obtained in the
variable count. Also specify a simple data structure to store the
obtained tokens.

Function required:
  strtok()
 
Arguments:
  inStr:  The input string.
  WSPACE: Character array of separators. "\n \t".
  count:  The number of obtained tokens.
*/

char WSPACE[] = "\n \t";
