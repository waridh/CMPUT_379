Make targets:
	a1p2:	The target will generate the executable for assignment 1 part 2. You
				will want to run the executable afterwards using './'.
	
	a1p3:	This target will generate the execuatble for assignment 1 part 3. Same
				things apply as part 2.

	all:	Runs by default if you call make. This will compile all programs into
				executables. Including the test programs like do_work.c. It will also
				create the test file bash.man given in the example pdf.
	
	bash.man:	Creates the test input file from the unix bash manual. Needed for
						my custom test with at least 5 seconds real runtime input.

	do_work:	Compiles the do_work.c test program.

	clean:	The clean target will get rid of all intermediary objects, test files
					, executables, and outputs. Run it often


Files:
	a1p2.cpp:	The code for assignment 1 part 2. Needs to be compiled.

	a1p3.cpp:	The code for assignment 1 part 3. Needs to be compiled.

	do_work.c:	The test program given in eclass. Used to run heavier load
							processes. It's involved in the custom test case required as a
							deliverable
